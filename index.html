<ul>
<font color="Orange"><li>To Listen To Music:</li></font>
<p>I like to listen to several genres, such as Rap, Rock or Classical.
I enjoy songs by the Beetles(Penny Lane) and Queen(Bohemian Rhapsody)
I also found classical instrumental music often helps me focus such as
Furlise by Beethoven.</p>
<font color="Orange"><li>Enjoy Playing Board Games Like Chess:</li></font>
<p> I have both a Chess and Carrom Boards. I usually play with
my brother and mother. I have also played against my grandfather
who is quite good at both games, and is the best in the family(I Only 
Came Close To Beating Him)</p>
<font color="Orange"><li>To Code Websites (Such As This One).</li></font>
<p>My brother taught me some of the basics of html, and I learned quite 
a bit off the Internet. One of my best websites took me hours to make,
where but unfortuanatley I lost the code for it.</p>
<font color="Orange"><li>To Read And Enjoy Writing.</li></font>
<p>I have loads of writing, and enjoy writing just about anything, especially
fantasy. I feel my writing is quite good, and my ideas are interesting, but often
are left un-finished due to school or some other reason.</p>
